# Airport Simulation Project
This is an Airport Simulation Program made using Python and various libraries

## Libraries Used
- Simpy (for simulation)
- PyQt5 (for GUI)
- Random (for generating passengers)

## Features
This airport simulation considers just the time spent in three counters in an airport:
1. Check in counter
2. Security Counter
3. Boarding Counter

and the default number of counters are 5, 5, and 1 respectively
These can be changed by changing the parameters of the constructor of the Airport Class

Other parameters like the number of passengers, and their arrival time limit can also be changed from their default values of (100 and 100 respectively) by changing the corresponding arguments in the constructor.
